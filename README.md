# Algorithms in Dart

Implementation of several algorithms with Dart programming language.

I will be implementing algorithms (In random order, perhaps) with Dart as I am learning this simple language. This readme will be updated with each implementation.

Use `dartdoc` to generate documentation.

## Lists

List data structures are implemented under the package `lists`.

### SinglyLinkedList

`lib/lists/singly_linked_list.dart`

### DoublyLinkedList

`lib/lists/doubly_linked_list.dart`

### CircularLinkedList

`lib/lists/circular_singly_linked_list.dart` and `lib/lists/circular_doubly_linked_list.dart`

### Stack

`lib/lists/stack.dart`

### Queue

`lib/lists/queue.dart`

## Heaps

### BinaryHeap

`lib/heaps/binary_heap.dart` - `BinaryHeap`, `MinHeap` and `MaxHeap`

## Sorts

## Basic Sorts

`lib/sorts/basic.dart` - `Bubble Sort` and `Heap Sort`
